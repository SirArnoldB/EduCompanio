## About

### Description and Purpose

EduCompanio is an all-in-one platform designed to assist students in organizing, planning, and building their careers. It offers a comprehensive suite of features that cater to various aspects of a student's academic and professional journey. By integrating functionalities like tracking internships, preparing for interviews, and skill development, EduCompanio aims to streamline the process of career planning and advancement for students.

### Inspiration

Our inspiration comes from personal experiences as college students and the challenges faced by our peers. We observed that students often find it difficult to navigate through the job application process, establish a clear career path, access resources efficiently, and learn from past experiences. EduCompanio is our solution to these challenges - a one-stop platform for students to organize, plan, and build their careers effectively.
