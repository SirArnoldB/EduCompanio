## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

- Creating the entity relationship diagram for our database: We had to think about the different tables and how they would relate to each other.
- Creating the wireframes for our app: We had to think about the different pages and how they would look like.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

- We will need support with the implementation of the features we have planned for the app - some features are more complex than others, for example, the Trello-like boards.
